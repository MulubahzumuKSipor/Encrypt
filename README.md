# SecureMessage Pro

## Overview

As a software engineer, I am constantly working to strengthen my understanding of programming languages by building practical applications that reflect real-world use cases. This project was created to deepen my knowledge of C# by applying it to a security-focused problem, while also reinforcing good software design and coding practices.

**SecureMessage Pro** is a desktop application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text messages using a password. The application uses modern cryptographic techniques to ensure that messages remain private and protected from unauthorized access.

The purpose of this software was to explore how C# handles security-sensitive operations, object-oriented design, and interaction with built-in libraries. Through this project, I focused on learning how to properly use cryptographic APIs instead of attempting to implement encryption manually, which is critical for building secure applications.

A video demonstration of the software, including a walkthrough of the application and an explanation of the code and C# language features used, can be found here:

## Development Environment

The software was developed using **Visual Studio** as the primary development environment. Visual Studio provided debugging tools, IntelliSense, and project management features that made it easier to structure and test the application effectively.

The application is written in **C# using .NET 6** and uses **Windows Forms** for the desktop user interface. For encryption and security-related functionality, the project relies on the built-in **System.Security.Cryptography** library, including AES encryption and PBKDF2 for secure key derivation.
